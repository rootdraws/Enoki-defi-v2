# Enoki Contracts

## Spore Token

Spore tokens are used in the game mechanics of Enoki projects. There is a 230,000 supply.

* 15,000 is distributed in the Presale
* 5,000 is locked for initial liquidity, to be vested to the Enoki Club DAO over 24 monthes
* 210,000 is locked in the Missions to be distributed in Spore farming pools.

## Spore Pools

Each pool has a distribution rate in SPORE / second. This rate can be halved or doubled by the ENOKI voters via a vote every X blocks. Pools do not mint SPORE, they take it out of the Missions.

## Missions

The Missions hold the spores which are taken by Spore pools when users harvest. When it runs out, no more rewards can be harvested until it is topped up with funds by the Enoki Club DAO.

## Mushroom Factory

When harvesting from Spore pools, users can choose to burn some of their spores for mushrooms. Riskier pools generate stronger mushrooms. The price per mushroom is set in the Pool contract.

## Incubator

Plant your mushrooms in the Incubator to gather ENOKI. Mushrooms have a random lifespan, and once planted this lifespan decreases until the mushroom dies. During it's lifespan it will harvest ENOKI. Once a mushroom has died, remove it from the ground to harvest your ENOKI. If you remove a mushroom before it's lifespan is up, it will retain it's remaining lifespan and can be planted again in the future. 5% of harvested ENOKI is sent to the Dev vesting contract to fund continued development. Each account can plant a maximum of 3 mushrooms at a time. This value can be modified by the DAO governance.

### Mushroom Properties

Each mushroom has the following properties:

* A species. Each pool creates a different species of mushroom.
* A strength, which is based on the species of mushroom. Mushrooms from riskier pools are stronger.
* A lifespan, which is randomly determined within a range for that species when the mushroom in harvested using SPORES.

## Enoki Club DAO

An Aragon DAO that governs the Enoki system. The ENOKI token is the governance token of the Club DAO.

## Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
