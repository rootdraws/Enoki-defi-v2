// This is a contract that the ENOKI DAO can execute, which hires a new artist to launch a new marketing campaign. These ought to be contracts that the DAO can easily call, which will execute something -- these are basically the powers that ENOKI will allow you to have, in being a holder of ENOKI -- you get to control what art campaigns happen, who is hired, etc.
